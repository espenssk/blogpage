### What Is Phishing?

Phishing is when an attacker pretends to be someone you trust to steal your login info, credit card numbers, or identity.

### Common Signs

- Unfamiliar email addresses
- Urgent requests (“Your account will be deleted”)
- Links that don’t match their destination

### What to Do

Don’t click unknown links. Use multi-factor authentication, and report phishing emails when possible.
