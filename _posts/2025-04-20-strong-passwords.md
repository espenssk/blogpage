### The Anatomy of a Strong Password

Good passwords are:

- At least 12 characters
- Include numbers, symbols, uppercase and lowercase letters
- Unique to each account

### Tips

- Use a password manager (like Bitwarden or 1Password)
- Don’t reuse passwords
- Enable 2FA where possible

> A good password won’t help you if it’s reused 20 times.
