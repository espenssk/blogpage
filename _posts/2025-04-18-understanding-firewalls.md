### What Is a Firewall?

A firewall is a network security system that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing traffic based on predetermined security rules. Firewalls are essential for both personal and business-level security, and they serve as the first line of defense in a network.

### Types of Firewalls

There are several types of firewalls:

- **Packet-filtering firewalls**
- **Stateful inspection firewalls**
- **Proxy firewalls**
- **Next-generation firewalls (NGFWs)**

Each of these has different capabilities depending on the environment and security needs.

### Why Firewalls Matter

They help:

- Prevent unauthorized access
- Monitor and log traffic
- Enforce policy controls

> "Firewalls are not optional anymore â€” they're foundational."

### Getting Started

To implement a firewall at home:

4. Keep firmware up to date
