### Zero Trust Explained

Instead of trusting internal networks, Zero Trust treats every request as untrusted. It assumes attackers can already be inside the network.

- Verify identity always
- Limit access by role
- Monitor all network traffic

### Why It Matters

Zero Trust reduces attack surfaces and limits lateral movement, even if a breach occurs.
